Whereas braces are metal or ceramic brackets that are bonded/fixed on your teeth till your teeth are aligned. They are easy to notice, hard to clean and non-removable.</p>
                        <h5>16. Do I Need To Visit The Dentist’s Clinic Often, Like In Case Of Braces?</h5>
                        <p>Not at all, aligners require only a few dental visits, just to check the treatment progression or any issue with the fitting of aligners. While in braces, a patient needs to visit the dental clinic frequently to tighten the wires and undergo modifications.</p>
                        <h5>17. How Is Oral Hygiene Easy With Aligners?</h5>
                        <p>When it comes to oral hygiene, it is an essential part of our day-to-day living and an integral part of our overall health. With braces, you need to maintain oral hygiene many times in a day because of food particles getting stuck in your braces, whereas in aligners you just have to wash them whenever you remove them to eat or brush your teeth.</p>
                        <h5>18. Is There Any Chance Of Aligner Breakage Or Damage?</h5>
                        <p>Clear aligners are made up of a strong medical-grade plastic. There are little or no chances of any breakage or damage if you remove and wear them carefully according to your dentist’s instructions. With braces, the patient faces a tough time in maintaining metallic wires and brackets.</p>
                        <h5>19. What Are The Food Restrictions While Wearing Clear Aligners?</h5>
                        <p>Clear aligners are completely removable. Therefore, you can have any food or drink you want just by removing them. There are no food restrictions in clear aligners. But always clean your mouth and the aligners when you wear them back again.</p>
                        <h4>Do’s and Don’ts of Clear Aligner</h4>
                        <h5>20. Do I Need To Remove Aligners While Eating?</h5>
                        <p>Aligners allow you to eat and drink whatever you want. As aligners are made of medical-grade plastic, they are prone to get damaged if exposed to heat or chemicals. Therefore, if, you eat or drink anything while wearing aligners, it will diminish the quality and color of the aligner and may disfigure them. As a result, they will not work efficiently anymore. Therefore, you must remove them during eating or drinking.</p>
                        <h5>21. I Start My Day With Tea/Coffee, Do I Need To Remove Aligners?</h5>
                        <p>Yes, tea and coffee and contain high amounts of color pigment. If you wear aligners when you are drinking coffee or tea, it will leave color on the aligner and the aligner will become discolored. So, remove the aligner during such consumption.</p>
                        <h5>22. Can I Chew Gum While Wearing Aligners?</h5>
                        <p>Chewing gum is not suitable for aligners as it may get stuck in the aligners and damage them. Therefore, orthodontists advise you not to do so.</p>
                        <h5>23. Can I Drink Alcohol When Wearing My Aligners?</h5>
                        <p>No, because of the high sugar content in alcohol, it will discolor the aligners. You should make sure sugar does not get trapped between your teeth and aligner. The same applies to other sugary beverages also.
                        </p>
                        <h5>24. Can I Sleep Wearing Clear Aligners?</h5>
                        <p>Of course, you can. In fact, while you are sleeping, aligners get enough time to work. But clean the aligners and your mouth when you wake up in the morning and insert them back again.</p>
                        <h5>25. Will Aligners Affect My Speech?</h5>
                        <p>Only at the initial stage, you may experience some discomfort/lisp while speaking. Once your mouth becomes habitual to aligners, it won’t affect your speech anymore.</p>
                        <h4>Cases treatable with Aligner</h4>
                        <h5>26. Can My Crooked Teeth Be Treated With Clear Aligners?</h5>
                        <p>The Aligner can effectively straighten crooked teeth. Discuss your requirements with your dentist during the consultation.
                        </p>
                        <h5>27. What Is A Poor Bite? How Can It Be Corrected?</h5>
                        <p>A poor bite is quite common. Normally, your upper teeth overlap the lower teeth by 2 mm. When the lower teeth overlap the upper teeth, it is called a cross-bite even if it is a single-tooth overlap. Such kind of poor bite can be corrected with the clear aligner treatment.</p>
                        <h5>28. What If Someone Is Having Gaps Between Teeth?</h5>
                        <p>Aligners can also correct the gaps between teeth. Clear aligners gradually close the gap between the teeth by moving them closer.</p>
                        <h4>Aligners Cost</h4>
                        <h5>29. How Much Does Clear Aligner Treatment Cost?</h5>
                        <p>Well, it depends on the individual case requirements. No prediction can be made without consultation. The cost depends on the number of aligners required to correct your teeth. Ask an orthodontist to know about the exact treatment cost in your case.</p>
                        <h5>30. Can I Pay The Treatment Fee In Installments?</h5>
                        <p>We have flexible payment options, including installments. Please contact your dentist to know the details.
                        </p>
                        <h5>31. What are the 3-month braces cost in India? Or what is the cost of braces for the front 4 teeth?</h5>
                        <p>It is very difficult to correct even mild teeth misalignment in 3 months, either by metal braces or invisible braces. Usually, teeth aligner cost starts from 5000 monthly. It takes 5-6 months for an appreciable teeth correction.
                        </p>
